"""Replay Engine: Replays recorded runs against new or modified policies.

Given a previously recorded ``RunRecord``, the replay engine re-evaluates
every planned action through the Gatekeeper with (optionally) different
policy rules.  This enables counterfactual analysis -- "what *would* have
happened if these policies had been in effect?"
